				Anatomy of the muscles of the legs is the interweaving of dozens of large, medium and small groups. The legs are the most complex and interconnected muscle system in the body, intertwined with the abs and lower back. Even relatively small calves consist of a series of small muscles lying at various depths. That is why it is better to make leg training according to the principle of regular rotation of types of exercises.

				The largest muscles in the legs are the quadriceps (quadriceps), gluteus, and posterior thigh muscles (including the biceps femoris). The front thigh muscles are recommended to swing with squats and bench presses, and the muscles of the buttocks and back of the thigh - in swings and steps. There are also muscles of the outer and inner thighs that work with intelligence and dilutions.
