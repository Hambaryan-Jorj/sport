	        	<p>Triceps should be downloaded no more than once or twice a week, and the total number of sets in the exercises should not exceed 4-6. The number of repetitions is average, at the border of 8-15 repetitions in each set. As in the case with other rather “small” muscle groups, triceps can be easily inflated with only two correctly selected isolating exercises.

	            <p><strong>
	            Triceps back push-ups</strong><br>
	            Starting position - the heels touch the floor, hands on the bench behind. Slowly lower the body down, linger at the lower point, return to the starting position. For complication, use the extra load by putting weight on your hips.
	            </p>
	            <p><strong>
	            French bench press</strong><br>
	            The essence of the exercise is to slowly lift the weight from the head up. Most often performed with a curved EZ-bar.
	            </p>
	            <p><strong>
	            Narrow grip bench press</strong><br>
	            Exercise to work out the medial triceps head. Lie on a bench, take a barbell or dumbbell with a narrow grip (10-15 cm). At run time, the elbows should be as close to the body as possible.
	            </p>
	            <p><strong>
	            Extending arms from behind the head</strong><br>
	            Sit on a bench with your back straight. With one hand lower the dumbbell behind the head, slowly return to the starting position. Keep your abs tense during exercise.
