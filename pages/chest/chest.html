				Note that most exercises for the pectoral muscles can be performed both with a barbell, and with dumbbells or on blocks. Dumbbells and blocks allow you to use stabilizer muscles in the exercise and precisely pump individual chest bundles, while the bar is the preferred choice when working with heavy weight, since its range of motion is usually trimmed.

	            1. Push-ups from the floor </strong><br>
	            -key anatomical exercise for chest muscles. If you want to pump up your chest, you first need to learn how to do push-ups correctly in order to be able to feel the pectoral muscles in work. However, note that push-ups have a very limited resource for breast growth, since they do not allow you to work with extra weight
	            </p>
	            <p><strong>
	            2. Push-ups on the uneven bars </strong><br>
	            -one of the best exercises for the comprehensive study of the upper part of the body, and, in particular, the lower part of the pectoral muscles, the entire shoulder girdle and triceps. When lowering, the movement should be slow and controlled, while lifting up - powerful and jerky (as if you push the body up).

	            </p>
	            <p><strong>
	            3. Bench press</strong><br>
	            - basic strength exercise for the pectoral muscles. When performing a bench press, it is extremely important to follow the technique - do not relax the muscles at the upper and lower points of movement, do not straighten your elbows and never touch the barbell of your chest. Raise the bar up, slowly counting 1-2, hold onto 3-4 and lower to the score 5-6.
	            </p>
	            <p><strong>
	            4. Разведение гантелей лежа </strong><br>
	            - A key exercise for working out the front dentate muscle and giving the chest the correct “square” shape. Use not too heavy dumbbell weights, focusing primarily on the feeling of muscle strain. At the lowest point of movement, do not lower your elbows too low and do not spread your arms too wide.
