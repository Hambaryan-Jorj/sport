					Unlike most body muscles that require exercises from different angles, the biceps are almost flat, thus limiting the amplitude of movement (in fact, biceps can only lift weight). That is why, when performing the exercises below, it is extremely important to follow the correct technique and the feeling of work of the biceps.
	        	</p><br>
		        	<p> <strong> 
		        	1. Lifting the barbell for biceps</strong><br> is the most anatomical exercise for developing biceps, because when lifting and lowering the weight, the movement is as close as possible to the natural movement of the joint. When performing the exercise, make sure that the body does not sway, and the elbows do not come forward.
		        	</p><br>
		        	<p> <strong>
		        	2. Lifting the EZ-bar to the biceps </strong><br>- it is believed that the use of a curved bar in an exercise significantly enhances the involvement of the biceps in the work, since with an easy turn of the palm its inner part is more actively involved in the movement. The result is a more voluminous and "spherical" biceps.</p>
		        	<p><strong>
		        	3. Lifting dumbbell “hammer”</strong><br> - the stronger you turn your hand when doing this exercise, the more noticeably the short part of the biceps is included in the work. However, make sure that only the forearm moves - the elbow should be fixed, but not pressed tightly to the body.
		        	</p>
		        	<p><strong>
		        	4. Concentrated lifting for biceps</strong><br> - the goal of this exercise is to slowly and consciously lift the dumbbell due to the strength of the biceps. Do not try to use excessively heavy weight, as if throwing dumbbells up while lifting - this shifts the load on the shoulders and back, contributing to the development of pain in the neck.</p>
