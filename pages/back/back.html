				Pull-ups for the back</strong>
	            </p>
	            <p>
	            Weak back muscles do not allow a beginner to engage them in work even in typical exercises - pull-ups develop a habit of lifting upwards in jerky movements at the expense of the arm muscles, and in the deadlift and pull of the barbell to the belt, the whole body is included in the work, but not the broadest back muscles.
	            </p>
	            <p>
	            The program of the first month of the "Beginner's Guide" included 10 pull-ups as the first exercise. Frankly - did you either skip them or did the exercise “somehow”? It's time to correct mistakes and learn to pull up correctly. It is really important for the development of the body.</p>
	            <p><strong>
                The right pull-up technique</strong></p>
	            <p>An exercise in which beginners are encouraged to learn how to “feel” the muscles of their backs is sitting in the upper block - an analog of pull-ups performed on the simulator. Moderate working weight, slow execution speed and attention to the mechanics of movement will quickly show a noticeable result.
                </p>
                <p>The key moment of the technique when performing the traction of the upper block is the position of the hands and the initial position in which the palms must necessarily lie on the bar from above. We especially note that the thumb should also be on top - this will transfer the load from the hand to the muscles of the back.
